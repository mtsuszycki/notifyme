make install

(it will copy notifyme binary to /usr/local/bin with root as owner
and with permissions set to 0755)

edit notifyrc.sample and copy to $HOME/.notifyrc	

If you find this tool useful then probably 
it will be a good idea to put following line:

/usr/bin/notifyme

to your profile file (ie. $HOME/.bash_profile)
